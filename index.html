    <p><b>Gender inequalities: Women researchers require more knowledge in specific and experimental topics</b></p>
    <p>Gender inequalities in science have long been observed globally. Studies have demonstrated it through survey data or published literature, focusing on the interests of subjects or authors; few, however, examined the manifestation of gender inequalities on researchers’ knowledge status. This study analyzes the relationship between regional and gender identities, topics, and knowledge status while revealing the female labor division in science and scientific research using online Q&A from researchers. We find that gender inequalities are merged with both regional-specific characteristics and global common patterns. Women’s field and topic distribution within fields are influenced by regions, yet the prevalent topics are consistent in all regions. Women are more involved in specific topics, particularly topics about experiments with weaker levels of knowledge and they are of less assistance. To promote inequality in science, the scientific community should pay more attention to reducing the knowledge gap and encourage women to work on unexplored topics and areas. </p>

    <p><b>The impact of marriage on the output and career of women scholars</b></p>
    <p>Marriage has potential impact on scholarship, especially for women, but lack of appropriate data has prevented its clear assessment. In this article we quantify the impact of marriage on women's scholarship using open data from ORCID(23057 married women scholars are recognized), including longitudinal productivity data and career path. So far we have find marriage have short term negative impact but long term active impact on productivity of women scholars and this impact varies according to the field they worked in. The short term negative impact is more significant if they get married after they are normally employed. We now continue working on other parts of this research, for instance, the impact of marriage on women scholar's career.</p>

    <p><b>Global scientific knowledge flow: Free circulated or blocked by borders?</b></p>
    <p>A contemporary imaginary that foresees the eventual elimination of national borders altogether by a relentless process of globalization, anticipated methodologically by decoupling the global from the national. The modern scientific inquiry seems to many to be "the closest thing to a perfectly globalized system that we possess," a system in which it is easy to assume that "knowledge simply travels by itself across borders." But is that true?</p>
    <p>Rather than thinking about transnational and global flows in terms that tend to presume the (relative) openness of the world, we need to excavate the structured networks and webs through which interconnections are made and maintained. What's more, the flow of knowledge can reshape the relationship between the nodes in the network and reconfigure the local settings in which it was produced and used. And the local settings can also react on knowledge flow. So in this research we considered following questions:</p>
    <p>(1) To build structured networks and to find out how knowledge flow through networks. </p>
    <p>(2) Is scientific knowledge "a perfectly globalized system" and can simply travels by itself across borders? If not, what about the cross-border effect through knowledge flow?</p>
    <p>(3) How knowledge flow is regulated, impeded or reshaped?What about the disjuncture and the working of local nation?</p>
    <p>using data of citation, cooperation, and migration of scholars extracted from Microsoft Academic Knowledge Graph with more than 200 million publications and 8 billion triples. We try to build global knowledge distribution maps and global knowledge flow network maps. We try to reveal characteristics of global knowledge flow network(compared with same sized random network) and the change of network position matrix. Considering national factors like geographical distance, knowledge ability, R&D investment etc. We use Temporal Exponential Random Graph Model (TERGM) to figure out the constraint imposed by country border in different knowledge flow network and what factor matter in global knowledge flows in past years.</p>
